The Setting Sun

The clerk, with scarcely a glance at the room, had the effrontery to say,
Why don’t you forget the whole idea? After all, the furniture doesn't belong to you.
Very well!
I said with animation,
just take the things I have bought with my own pocket money.
But not a one of all the odds and ends I piled before him had any value as a pledge.
Item. A hand in plaster. This was the right hand of Venus. A hand like a dahlia blossom, a pure white hand, mounted on a stand.
But if you looked at it carefully you could tell how this pure white, delicate hand, with whorl-less finger tips and unmarked palms, expressed,
so pitifully that even the beholder was stabbed with pain, the shame intense enough to make Venus stop her breath;
in the gesture was implicit the moment when Venus’ full nakedness was seen by a man, when she twisted away her body,
flushed all over with the prickling warmth of her shock, the whirlwind of her shame, and the tragedy of her nudity.
Unfortunately, this was only a piece of bric-a-brac. The clerk valued it at fifty sen.
